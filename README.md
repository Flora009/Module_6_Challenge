# Module_6_Challenge


## Background
Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. Assume that youâ€™re an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.

Your job is to use your data visualisation skills, including aggregation, interactive visualisations, and geospatial analysis, to find properties in the San Francisco market that are viable investment opportunities.

## Requirement

- Calculate and Plot the Housing Units per Year
- Calculate and Plot the Average Sale Prices per Square Foot
- Compare the Average Sale Prices by Neighbourhood
- Build an Interactive Neighbourhood Map
- Compose Your Data Story:
  1. How does the trend in rental income growth compare to the trend in sales prices? Does this same trend hold true for all the neighbourhoods across San Francisco?
  2. What insights can you share with your company about the potential one-click, buy-and-rent strategy that they're pursuing? Do neighbourhoods exist that you would suggest for investment, and why?
